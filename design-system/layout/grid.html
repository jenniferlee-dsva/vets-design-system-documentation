            <p>Virginia, is a U.S. state located in the South Atlantic region of the United States. Virginia, formally the Commonwealth of Virginia, is nicknamed the "Old Dominion" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland
                British America, and "Mother of Presidents" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide
                habitat for much of its flora and fauna.</p>
